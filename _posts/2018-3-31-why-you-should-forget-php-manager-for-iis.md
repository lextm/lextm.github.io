PHP on IIS was something Microsoft promoted with lots of efforts. Tools like PHP Manager for IIS do help attract users. Even I [wrote about it](https://blog.lextudio.com/product-review-php-manager-for-iis-e17105c8f751) in 2011. However, time flies, and it is now time to say goodbye to it and let it die peacefully. Why?

* Its original developer(s) abandoned the project on CodePlex.
* CodePlex was archived earlier this year, so was the homepage of PHP Manager.
* Nobody picks it up nor makes a trustable fork yet.
* The source code and installer does not work with latest IIS, such as IIS 10.
